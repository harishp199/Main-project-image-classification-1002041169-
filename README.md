# Main-project-image-classification-1002041169-
Here we are doing image classification with multiple algorithms mainly we have used SVM,Random Forest, KNN amoung them Random forest performed Better.
we did not built the entire algorithm we used sklearn library and we trained all our algorithms with 80% of data and we used 20% FOR TESTING.
We also made predections on them using image from google and it predicts it properly
mainly the image we use for prediction should be clear to get correct predection
When a pictiure with noise cause overfitting 
We also made experiments on Randomforest and svm 
On  experiments with svm we use GridSearchCV to find best hyper parameters and then we when we use them the random forest gives hiher accuracy than actual accuracy
We also made experiments on Svm by changing the parameters.
