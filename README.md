# Main-project-image-classification-1002041169-
Here we are doing image classification with multiple algorithms mainly we have used SVM,Random Forest, KNN amoung them Random forest performed Better.
we have used the sklearn library and we trained all our dataset with 80% of training and 20% FOR TESTING.
We also made predections on them using image from google( one of the disease leaf image) and it predicts correctly.
mainly the image we use for prediction should be clear to get correct predection
prediction can cause overfitting when we want to predict the unseen or untrained data.
We also made experiments on Randomforest and svm 
On  experiments with svm we use GridSearchCV to find best hyper parameters and then we when we use them the random forest gives higher accuracy than actual accuracy
We also made experiments on Svm by changing the parameters.
